## Proposal

 This engine was made as an experiment. \
 Some points to be discussed:
- This engine uses bazel as the main build tool. I don't know why exactly I took this decision,
  but, if I'm make sure, it's because I don't know how to use cmake, premake or something hahaha.
  Bazel is a good automation tool too for N reasons.
